# =============================================================================
# OpenClaw Agent Deployment (Separate Server)
# =============================================================================
# Runs OpenClaw on its own server, connected to the gateway via private network.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Hetzner private network between servers (10.0.0.0/16)
#   - Gateway accessible at private IP (default: 10.0.0.2:4000)
#   - SSH key for gateway access (gateway_key in this directory)
#
# Setup:
#   1. Copy .env.example to .env and fill in secrets
#   2. Place gateway SSH private key as ./gateway_key
#   3. docker compose up -d
#
# Update:
#   docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d
#
# Access:
#   - Local: http://localhost:18789 (via nginx proxy on host)
#   - Public: https://clawd.agenticway.io (after nginx/certbot setup)
