# Claude Compatibility Shim

This file is compatibility-only for Claude Code.

Canonical policy: `AGENTS.md`
Canonical skills index: `SKILLS.md`

Claude-specific notes:

- Respect local settings and memory files as local preferences, not canonical policy.
- Use `AGENTS.md` for normative behavior and guardrails.
- If this file conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.md` wins.
